<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# [Pig Game] <a name="about-project"></a>

**[Pig Game]** Pig Game is an exciting JavaScript-based two-player game that adds a thrilling twist to the classic dice-rolling experience. In this game, two players take turns rolling a virtual dice, each hoping to avoid the dreaded "1."

The objective is simple: be the last player standing! The game starts with Player 1 rolling the dice, and their goal is to avoid rolling a 1. If they succeed, they can accumulate points by rolling higher numbers. However, if a 1 appears, the dice passes to Player 2.

Player 2 then takes their turn, trying to roll anything but a 1. The game continues with players taking turns, hoping to outlast their opponent. It's a game of chance, strategy, and nerves of steel.

Pig Game is perfect for a quick and fun gaming session with a friend or family member. Are you up for the challenge? Roll the dice and see who emerges victorious in this thrilling game of dice-rolling strategy!
